    <p>For users of Assistive Technology, this page is intended to give you an overview of GEAR (the GSA EA Analytics
      and Reporting tool), in order to provide a frame of reference for further navigation.
    <p>The main landing page consists of six major navigation links to the left ("IT Strategy,"" GSA Enterprise,"
      "Business Applications," "Security," "Technologies," and "Access Forms & Glossary") that open up to list different
      sub-sections (such as "IT Strategic Framework" or "IT Investments" under the "Strategy" navigation link). These
      navigation links are available on every one of the GEAR pages on the left side.
    <p>There are also three information links on the top navigation bar ("About", "Assistive Technology" (this page),
      and "Contact/Feedback,"). These links take you to descriptive pages (like this one) that are formatted differently
      than the main sections linked on the left of the page.
    <p>The "Business Capabilities Model" and "Organization Chart" links under the "GSA Enterprise" navigation link
      display dynamic charts that are interactive with a network of connected nodes, showing the relationships between
      capabilities or organizations. Accompanying each dynamic chart is a table that contains the same information. For
      example, under the "GSA Enterprise" navigation link, there is a "Business Capability Model" that visually depicts
      the same information that is available in the "Business Capability List."
