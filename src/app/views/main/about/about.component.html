            GSA Enterprise Architecture (EA) Analytics and Reporting (AR), or GEAR, 
            provides commonly-used strategic, business, and technical information. 
            Use GEAR to gain insight into the common direction for GSA IT, and get 
            the data you need to do your job.

            <br /><br />
            GEAR combines authoritative sources of Agency data with helpful references 
            between the datasets to make the data actionable and to provide a more holistic 
            understanding of GSA and its operations.

        <p>The Office of Digital Management (IR) team provides strategic and policy support for GSA
          customers across the entire organization. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is responsible for providing the
          necessary support for designing organizational changes based on ever-evolving programmatic requirements. EA is
          involved in business transformation planning through the modeling of existing processes and environments and
          the development of roadmaps to reach the desired target states. In addition, EA is responsible for assessing
          the impact of change across the organization such as business, application, and technological layers.</p>

        <h4>Sources of Data</h4>
        <p>GEAR aims to be a hub of data by relying on authoritative sources of information as much as possible. We strive 
          to limit the redundancy of data calls by determining if data can be imported from existing systems. 
          For that reason, GEAR has formed partnerships with several organizations across GSA to import data, 
          analyze and make the proper references between data sets, and present it in an intuitive and actionable manner. 
          GEAR's data sources are provided in <a routerLink="/gear_model"><u>the GEAR Data Flow Model.</u></a></p> 
          
          <h4>GEAR API</h4>
          <p>The GEAR development team has built a set of openly available REST API services 
          (<a href="https://gsa.github.io/GEAR-Documentation/api-docs/"><u>documentation here</u></a>) to provide the data
          from this portal to other users who might need direct access to the EA data. Currently, the portal is
          available to all users within the GSA firewall.</p>

        <h4>Systems Rationalization</h4>
        <p>GSA’s Enterprise Architecture program uses a business-focused, 
          data-bs-driven methodology to analyze the IT application portfolio and help guide IT investment decisions. 
          This methodology is used to calculate whether a system should be tolerated, invested, migrated, or eliminated 
          (TIME). To derive the current TIME value of a business system, we ask system owners to work with their teams 
          to complete a <b>TIME Assessment Questionnaire</b>. For access to a TIME Assessment Questionnaire,
          please <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=ea_planning@gsa.gov"
          target="_blank"><u>contact the EA team</u></a>, and we will provide you with a custom link to a questionnaire for your system. 
        <br><br>
          If you provide a response to our TIME Assessment Questionnaire, it will be visible on 
          <a routerLink="/systems_TIME" class="card-link">the TIME report</a>.</p>

        <h4>TIME</h4>
        <p><b>Tolerate:</b> the business system is stable and meets business needs but may not be essential for future goals. 
          It requires minimal maintenance and can be kept for the time being.</p>

        <p><b>Invest:</b> the business system delivers high-value capabilities that are critical to the business and should be continuously improved and modernized.</p>

        <p><b>Migrate:</b> the business system is no longer meeting business needs or is technically outdated. It should be replaced with a newer, more suitable solution.</p>

        <p><b>Eliminate:</b> the business system is no longer used or is redundant. It should be decommissioned to free up resources.</p>
