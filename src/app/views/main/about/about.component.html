                <p> GSA Enterprise Architecture (EA) Analytics and Reporting (AR), or GEAR, provides commonly-used strategic, business, and technical information. Use GEAR to gain insight into the common direction for GSA IT, and get the data you need to do your job. <br /><br /> GEAR combines authoritative sources of Agency data with helpful references between the datasets to make the data actionable and to provide a more holistic understanding of GSA and its operations. </p>

                <p>The Office of Digital Management (IR) team provides strategic and policy support for GSA customers across the entire organization. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is responsible for providing the necessary support for designing organizational changes based on ever-evolving programmatic requirements. EA is involved in business transformation planning through the modeling of existing processes and environments and the development of roadmaps to reach the desired target states. In addition, EA is responsible for assessing the impact of change across the organization such as business, application, and technological layers.</p>

                <p>GEAR aims to be a hub of data by relying on authoritative sources of information as much as possible. We strive to limit the redundancy of data calls by determining if data can be imported from existing systems. For that reason, GEAR has formed partnerships with several organizations across GSA to import data, analyze and make the proper references between data sets, and present it in an intuitive and actionable manner. GEAR's data sources are provided in <a routerLink="/gear_model" class="card-link"><u>the GEAR Data Flow Model.</u></a></p>

                <p>GSA's Enterprise Architecture program uses a business-focused, data-bs-driven methodology to analyze the IT application portfolio and help guide IT investment decisions. This methodology is used to calculate whether a system should be tolerated, invested, migrated, or eliminated (TIME). To derive the current TIME value of a business system, we ask system owners to work with their teams to complete a <b>TIME Assessment Questionnaire</b>. For access to a TIME Assessment Questionnaire, please <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=ea_planning&#64;gsa.gov"

                  <h5>What is the purpose of filling out the TIME (system lifecycle) questionnaire?</h5>
                  <p>The TIME questionnaire is designed to assess the current state and future direction of GSA's IT systems and applications. It helps us understand whether each system or application should be Tolerated, Invested in, Migrated to a new solution, or Eliminated. This assessment is crucial for making informed IT investment decisions and ensuring our technology portfolio aligns with GSA's strategic goals.</p>
                  <h5>Why should I fill this out?</h5>
                  <p>Completing the TIME questionnaire helps ensure your system or application receives appropriate attention and resources. It provides valuable input for strategic planning and helps identify opportunities for modernization, consolidation, or retirement of systems. Your input directly influences how GSA allocates IT resources and prioritizes technology initiatives.</p>
                  <h5>What will be done with the data?</h5>
                  <p>The data collected through the TIME questionnaire is used to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Generate TIME analysis reports that inform IT investment decisions</li>
                    <li>Identify opportunities for system consolidation and modernization</li>
                    <li>Support strategic planning and budget allocation</li>
                    <li>Create transparency in our IT portfolio management</li>
                    <li>Help prioritize technology initiatives across the agency</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The results are visible on <a routerLink="/systems_TIME" class="card-link"><u>the TIME report</u></a> and are used by GSA leadership to make data-driven decisions about our technology investments.</p>
                  <h5>How can I propose changes to the questions or listed responses?</h5>
                  <p>We welcome feedback on the questionnaire structure and content. If you have suggestions for improving the questions or response options, please contact the EA team at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=ea_planning&#64;gsa.gov"
                      target="_blank" class="card-link"><u>ea_planning&#64;gsa.gov</u></a>. Your input helps us continuously improve the assessment process.</p>
